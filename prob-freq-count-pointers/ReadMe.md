# Problem Solving Assignment

This assignment consists of solving various coding problems. The problems are as follows:

1. **Average Pair**
   - Description: Checks if any pair of numbers in the given array sums to the given number.
   - File: `average-pair.js`
   - Test File: `average-pair.test.js`

2. **Construct Note**
   - Description: Checks if a message can be constructed from a set of letters.
   - File: `construct-note.js`
   - Test File: `construct-note.test.js`

3. **Count Pairs**
   - Description: Counts the number of pairs in the array that sum to the given number.
   - File: `count-pairs.js`
   - Test File: `count-pairs.test.js`

4. **Is Subsequence**
   - Description: Checks if a string is a subsequence of another string.
   - File: `is-subsequence.js`

5. **Longest Fall**
   - Description: Finds the length of the longest consecutive fall in an array of numbers.
   - File: `longest-fall.js`
   - Test File: `longest-fall.test.js`

6. **Pivot Index**
   - Description: Finds the pivot index of the given array nums. The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers to the right of the index.
   - File: `pivot-index.js`
   - Test File: `pivot-index.test.js`

7. **Same Frequency**
   - Description: Checks if two positive integers have the same frequency of digits.
   - File: `same-frequency.js`
   - Test File: `same-frequency.test.js`

8. **Separate Positives**
   - Description: Separates a numeric array into positive and negative numbers. Moves all positive numbers to the left side of the array and all negative numbers to the right side.
   - File: `separate-positive.js`
   - Test File: `separate-positive.test.js`

9. **Two Array Object**
   - Description: Creates an object from two arrays, where the keys are the items in the first array and the values are the items at the same index in the second array. If the second array is shorter than the first, null is used as the value for additional keys.
   - File: `two-array-object.js`
   - Test File: `two-array-object.test.js`
